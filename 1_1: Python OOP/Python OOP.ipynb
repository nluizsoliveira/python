    "# Python OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorials goal is summarizing python's OOP syntax and uses. It does not cover OOP theory: Target readers  have earlier experience with c++, java or another oop-driven language. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a class\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    # Class variables\n",
    "    company = 'Sigalei'\n",
    "    species = 'Human'    \n",
    "    total_employees = 0; \n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Initializer / Constructor\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, surname):  \n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.surname = surname\n",
    "        self.mail = f'{name}.{surname}@{company}.com'\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Employee.total_employees +=1\n",
    "        \n",
    "    # Regular method\n",
    "    def fullname(self): \n",
    "        return (self.name, self.surname)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Class Methods\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def company_status(cls):\n",
    "        print(f'Company name: {cls.company}, number of employees: {cls.total_employees}')\n",
    "        \n",
    "    # Static Method\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def is_workday(day):\n",
    "        if day == 'Sunday':\n",
    "            return False\n",
    "        else: \n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods and Constructor\n",
    "When creating regular methods within a class, they must have  ```self``` as an argument. Constructor is not an exception, and should initiate the class attributes using args received. Constructor is automatically called when instantiating a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantiation and calling methods\n",
    "Unlike defining the class, there's no need to pass ```self``` as an argument to constructor/functions when instantiating: It's already built-in passed as the first argument. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "employee_1 = Employee('Nelson', 'Oliveira')\n",
    "employee_2 = Employee('Nelson_2', 'Oliveira_2')\n",
    "employee_1.fullname()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class  Variables\n",
    "Variables (initially) owned by the Class, not its instances. Can be accessed via ```Class.variable```:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Employee.species)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, they may also be accessed by instances/objects. In this case, python down-top searches in parent classes for the variable.\n",
    "So, it's possible to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(employee_1.species)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying Class variables via ```Class``` will therefore modify the value for accesses made via instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Employee.species = 'dog'\n",
    "print(Employee.species, employee_1.species, employee_2.species)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prints **```dog dog dog ```**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is possible to append a new variable with the same name to an ```instance```, which will avoid the down-top search and also break the dependency-class-shared behavior of the variable for that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Employee.species = 'dog'\n",
    "employee_1.species = 'cat'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(Employee.species, employee_1.species, employee_2.species)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Prints **```dog cat dog```**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Methods\n",
    "Create methods relative to class variables. Requires the use of ``` @classmethod```decorator, which modify the functionality  of the expected first argument behavior, now no longer a ```self```, but a ```cls```. Class methods should be called from a ```Class``` and not its instances: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Employee.company_status()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Class methods are useful for creating customizable constructor for multiple arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Coordinate:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y, z):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "        self.z = z\n",
    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def constructor_by_string(cls, string):\n",
    "        x, y, z = [int(n) for n in string.split(',')]\n",
    "        return cls(x, y, z)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "pos_1 = Coordinate(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "pos_2 = Coordinate.constructor_by_string('1,2,3')\n",
    "\n",
    "print(pos_1.x == pos_2.x) #prints True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Methods\n",
    "Use ```@staticmethod``` decorator. Unlike regular methods that pass instance as ```self``` , and class methods that pass class as ```cls``` in the first argument, static methods pass nothing. Static Methods should be used when the operation does not need to access instance or class methods/attributes at all."
